    "Exception - In Python, an exception is an event or error that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exception occurs, Python stops executing the current code and jumps to the nearest exception handling code. Exception handling is a mechanism that allows you to deal with these unexpected errors gracefully, preventing the program from crashing and allowing you to take appropriate actions.\n",
